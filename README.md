# Godot Day/Night Cycle
Day/Night Cycle with customizable time and sky.
Available in both C# and GDScript.

By default a minute is 1 real second making a whole day be 24 real minutes long, but that can be adjusted to fit your needs (e.g. setting it to 60 means real 24 hour days)

A modified version of a sky shader is included. The [original shader](https://godotshaders.com/shader/stylized-sky/) was not made by me and uses an MIT license.

Example:
